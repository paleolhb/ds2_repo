the sea is calm tonight 
the tide is full
on the french coast the cliffs of england stand, glimmering and vast
out in the tranquil bay
come to the window, sweet is the night air!

only from the long line of spray
where the sea meets the moon blanched sand
listen! you can hear the grating roar
of pebbles which the waves draw back and fling 
on their return
begin, and cease, and again begin
with tremulous cadence slow, and bring 
the eternal note of sadness in

sophocles long ago heard it on the aegean 
and it brought to his mind the turbid ebb and flow
of human misery. We
find also in this sound a thought
hearing it by this distant northern sea.
